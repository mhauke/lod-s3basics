In this repository you will find various examples for using the S3 APIs with languages like Python and Go. 
The scripts a meant to be used in NetApps Lab on Demand environment but could easily adapted to work in other 
environments as well. 

Please note that the scripts in this repository are not for production use.

## Usage
For each language there is a number of scripts starting with two digits that suggest a specific order to execute. 

### Python
Change to the Python directory and run the scripts. You could also use 'python3 <script_name>'.
```
cd lod-s3basics/python
./01_list_buckets.py
```

## Usage - Go
For Go the code is organized in subdirectories for the different examples. To run an example, change to the directory for the example you want to run. 
```
cd lod-s3basics/golang/01_list_buckets
go run main.go
```
